# Project Documentation

### Introduction

 We are building a web app that lets members of a household or communal space receive automated fair rotations for tasks they want to share between them, mark them us Done so other people know that they have completed them and compete for a the first position on a leaderboard based on points they assign to tasks on their own, according to their own criteria.
 
### Project scope

 The scope of this project is to help users create their own spaces, add members in the spaces, and rotate tasks fairly between them.
We have decided letting users create Weekly rotations for tasks is the feature we want to provide as part of the MVP, and later on we plan to let them create daily rotations, as well.

### Project plan

(How are you going to structure your sprints?
What order are you going to build in?)
User research informed our plan from the beginning. We had a Design Week, where we decided on features and constraints based on user research and usability testing on a clickable Figma prototype.

### Requirement analysis

We will you ensure our project is accessible to as many users as possible by spreading the word about it in coworking or other communal spaces we are active, like Space4 in London. 
There are no legal or regulatory requirements to consider in this project.

### Project learnings

Our team worked effectively for this project.
What we would do differently next time is .................

### Research and findings

We had many findings from user testing. Users gave us opinions that we have considered on certain elements and their appearance (drop down menu, share link) as well as on what they want from a task rotation app and what data they want to view on the dashboard, the leaderboard etc. and how.

### Project outcomes

Our assumptions were mostly right. One user tester was neutral about the need for automatic rotations for teams in place of a paper rotation, which falsified our assuption that users would be positive about the need for automated task rotations.

### Recommendations and conclusions

The features we prioritise to build next, are a monthly rotation option and ....................
Overall, the project was a success, and ...............

### Software Development Lifecycle stages

With regards to planning, our team took on roles. These were Scrum Facilitator (Iman), DevOps (Karol), QA (Natalia and Georgia) and UX Lead (Konstantina).

Explain the roles and responsibilities of all people working within the software development lifecycle, and how they relate to the project (K2)

### Did these roles help your team work effectively?

Outline how teams work effectively to produce software and how to contribute appropriately 
(K6) Compare and contrast the requirements of a software development team, and how they would ensure that each member (including themselves) were able to make a contribution.

Analysis

What might be the intended and unintended consequences of building this product?......................
One unintended consequence might be competition between roommates.

Design

How did you plan a user experience?
What technical decisions did you make?
Server-render vs client-render vs both
Relational or non-relational or no DB
Self-hosted or platform-as-a-service
Frontend first vs DB first
Did you create a technical specification?

Review methods of software design with reference to functional/technical specifications and apply a justified approach to software development (K11, S11, S12)

Implementation/Build

How did you ensure your code was good?

Create logical and maintainable code to deliver project outcomes, explaining their choice of approach. (S1)

What interesting technical problems did you have to solve?

Outline and apply the rationale and use of algorithms, logic and data structures. (K9, S16)

How did you debug issues that arose?

Apply structured techniques to problem solving to identify and resolve issues and debug basic flaws in code (S7)

Test

How did you verify your project worked correctly?

Identify and create test scenarios which satisfy the project specification (S6)

Did writing automated tests catch any bugs?

Analyse unit testing results and review the outcomes, correcting errors. (S4)

Deploy

You can view a deployment of the application [here](https://goth-kking-oajofl86l-gothikk.vercel.app/)  

Review and justify their contribution to building, managing and deploying code into the relevant environment in accordance with the project specification (S10)

What problems did you encounter during deployment?

Maintain

Is it easy for someone make changes to the codebase?
Could a new person quickly be onboarded to contribute?
